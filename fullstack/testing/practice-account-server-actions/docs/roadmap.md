### **Phase 0: Proposed Step-by-Step Roadmap**

Here is the path I propose we take. We will tackle one item at a time.

1.  **Step 0: Project Initialization & Dependency Setup**
    * Ensure your Next.js project is set up correctly with TypeScript, Tailwind, and the `src` directory.
    * Install our core dependencies.

2.  **Step 1: Data Modeling with Zod & TypeScript (Your First Task)**
    * Before touching the database or UI, we must define the "shape" of our data. This is the most critical step.
    * We will use **Zod** to create schemas that serve as a single source of truth for TypeScript types, form validation, and API validation.

3.  **Step 2: Database Connection & Schema Implementation**
    * Set up a reusable connection to your MongoDB instance.
    * If desired, create Mongoose schemas that are derived from or validated by our Zod schemas.

4.  **Step 3: Authentication**
    * No banking application is useful without users. We will implement a robust authentication system. The modern standard for this is **Auth.js (formerly NextAuth)**.

5.  **Step 4: Building the First End-to-End Feature: User & Person Creation**
    * Create a simple UI with **Shadcn** components.
    * Write your first **Server Action** to handle form submission.
    * Use Zod for end-to-end validation.

6.  **Step 5: Introducing State Management**
    * Once we have multiple interacting components, we'll introduce **Zustand** for minimal, simple global state (e.g., managing the logged-in user's profile state across the app).

7.  **Step 6: Advanced Data Fetching & Caching**
    * We'll build the account page, fetching data with **React Query** and caching the results to avoid redundant database calls.
    * We will use **`nuqs`** to manage state within the URL search parameters, which is excellent for filters and sorting on your transaction or stock pages.

8.  **Step 7: Performance Optimization**
    * Finally, we will identify performance bottlenecks and strategically implement **Redis** for caching expensive database queries or computed results.
